  WHAT YOU CAN TRACK
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Artist Studio Pro manages seven types of inventory, each with
  its own color so you can tell them apart at a glance:

  ARTWORKS (violet)       Paintings, sculptures, mixed media.
                          Track dimensions, medium, series,
                          status, and location.

  SERIES (cyan)           Group related artworks into bodies
                          of work with themes, dates, and
                          descriptions.

  BOOKS (emerald)         Your reference library. Rate books,
                          categorize them, and link them to
                          the artworks they inspired.

  CHARACTERS (fuchsia)    Theatrical roles, personas, and
                          concepts. Track type, gender, age
                          range, era, and personality.

  PROPS & COSTUMES (rose) Period pieces, found objects, stage
                          properties, textiles, and jewelry.
                          Track era, condition, and materials.

  SUPPLIES (amber)        Paints, brushes, canvas, mediums,
                          and tools. Monitor stock levels
                          with automatic reorder alerts.

  VENDORS (blue)          Your suppliers, stores, and sources.
                          Keep websites, addresses, and notes
                          in one place.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  CROSS-REFERENCES: THE HEART OF THE APP
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  The real power is linking items together:

  - Which books influenced an artwork
  - Which supplies were used in a painting
  - Which props appear in which artworks
  - Which artworks belong to a series
  - Which vendor supplies which materials

  When you view any item's detail page, you'll see all of its
  connections in both directions. Tap a connected item to jump
  straight to it.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  SMART FILTERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Two special tabs help you stay on top of things:

  WIP         Shows only artworks with status "In Progress"
              so you can focus on current work.

  REORDER     Shows supplies that are "Low Stock" or
              "Out of Stock." A red indicator appears on
              the tab when you have items to reorder.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  TIPS FOR EVERYDAY USE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  SEARCH        Type in the search bar to find any item by
                name, title, author, brand, or medium.

  GRID / LIST   Toggle between a visual grid of cards and
                a compact list view using the icons next to
                the search bar.

  IMAGES        Drag and drop a photo onto any item, or
                click the image area to browse. Images are
                compressed automatically to save space.

  PRINT CARDS   On an artwork, series, book, or prop detail
                page, click the document icon to generate a
                printable reference card. Use "Print / Save
                PDF" to save or print it.

  HOVER TIPS    Hover over any icon button to see a text
                description of what it does.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  BACKING UP YOUR DATA
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Your data lives on your device in browser storage. This means
  it's completely private, but it can be lost if you clear your
  browser data. Always keep backups.

  QUICK EXPORT      Click the download icon in the header to
                    save a backup file to your Downloads folder.
                    The file is named with today's date.

  BACKUP TO FOLDER  Click the green folder icon to choose a
                    specific location, like an external drive
                    or cloud folder. Great for regular backups.

  IMPORT            Click the upload icon and select a backup
                    file to restore your data. This replaces
                    your current data, so export first if you
                    want to keep what you have.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
  PRIVACY & SECURITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - All data stays on YOUR device
  - Nothing is ever sent to a server
  - No accounts, no tracking, no analytics
  - Works completely offline after first load
  - You own your data; export it anytime

  TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  App won't load?
    Make sure you're opening index.html directly in a browser,
    not trying to open it from inside a zip file. Extract first.

  Data disappeared?
    If you cleared your browser data or cookies, your inventory
    may have been erased. Restore from a backup using Import.

  Images not showing?
    Very large images are compressed to save space. If an image
    fails to load, try a smaller version of the photo.

  Need more help?
    Click the "?" icon in the top-right corner of the app for
    built-in help documentation with detailed guides.
